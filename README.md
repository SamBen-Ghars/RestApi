 Web Services & REST API Learning Project

This is a Java-based native project designed to explore and understand web services and REST APIs. The project demonstrates how to:

✅ Create and expose RESTful APIs using JAX-RS (Jakarta EE)
✅ Implement CRUD operations for managing resources
✅ Consume web services using HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
✅ Work with JSON serialization/deserialization using @Consumes and @Produces
✅ Integrate with a MySQL database for data persistence (optional)
